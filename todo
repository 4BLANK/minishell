chnghl o mnghl: adfa: command not found



asdffasd > o1
should open o1 then check if the command is valid ola chi9lwa 

touch o2
chmod -w o2
echo hello > o1 > o2 > o3
!does not create o1 + does not throw error + prints hello to screen
(maybe builtin)


> o3
invalid read


""
should give cmd not found
